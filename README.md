# Rockman
A project based around an updated and fully versitile version of cortana.
Based on definition we refer to this being as a Navi.
This Navi is a customizable AI response tool that can function with its very own code operations and everyday uses that it can connect to phones, server OS, and can be contacted
through ssh as a means of production, these tools all culminate into the perfect being for on the go travel, buisness men, and even for everyday entertainment to run and maintain
home smart devices. 


I now present to you, Rockman.
